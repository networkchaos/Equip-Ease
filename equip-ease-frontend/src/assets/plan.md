# Equip Ease Platform - Feature Expansion Plan

## 1. Routing & Page Structure
- Implement new pages:
    - My Rentals (`myRentalsPage.js`): For farmers to see, book, and cancel equipment rentals.
    - My Equipment (`myEquipmentPage.js`): For owners to list, edit, view, and manage their equipment, bookings, and maintenance.
    - Equipment Details (`equipmentDetailsPage.js`): Shows details, availability calendar, booking, reviews, maintenance, etc.
    - Payments (`paymentsPage.js`): For viewing, making payments (mock M-Pesa integration), receipts.
    - Reviews (`reviewsPage.js`): Submit/view ratings after rentals.
    - Maintenance (`maintenancePage.js`): Owners log/view maintenance for their machines.
    - Notifications (`notificationsPage.js`): List all user notifications.
    - Community Board (`communityPage.js`): Posts, comments interface.
    - Admin Dashboard (`adminDashboardPage.js`): User/equipment/booking management.
- Update router setup to add navigation and access control for new pages.

## 2. Navigation & UI
- Expand navigation bar for quick access to new sections, with role-based visibility.
- Add real-time notification indicator in header/nav.
- Enhance color palette for a more lively, contemporary look.

## 3. Core Features (MVP interactivity)
- Equipment Owners:
    - Add/list/edit equipment with images, types, price, status.
    - View equipment details including bookings & maintenance.
    - Log maintenance (add/edit upcoming/completed maintenances).
- Farmers:
    - Search/filter equipment (name, type, location, price).
    - Book equipment (date picker/calendar), see availability.
    - View/cancel their bookings.
    - Leave review/rating after rental ends.
- Shared:
    - View notifications, mark as read.
    - View/post/comment in the community board.
    - Manage profile info.
- Payments:
    - Simulate M-Pesa payment flow, show status/receipts (UI only; no actual payment API).
- Admin:
    - Oversight panels for users, machines, bookings, and reports.

## 4. Visuals
- Utilize illustration icons and background images already provided.
- Use a primary color scheme with lively accent colors for buttons, status, calendar, etc.
- Cards for major entities (equipment, rentals, posts).
- Clean calendar widget for booking selection.

## 5. Responsive/Mobile Friendly
- Test layouts/scaling for mobile.
- Adjust paddings, font sizes, card grid for small screens.

## 6. Payments & Feedback

**Payments**
- Users (farmers) can view pending payments for their bookings under the "Payments" page.
- M-Pesa integration will be simulated in the UI (no live API for now).
- Users can see payment status ("Pending", "Paid"), reference numbers, and download/print receipts for completed payments.
- UI will show a payment button that, when clicked, will simulate the flow—showing confirmation, then updating the booking/payment status.
- Payments page is accessed from both the nav and dashboard.

**Feedback & Reviews**
- After a farmer completes a booking, they see an option on the "Reviews" page (or after marking a booking as complete) to rate the equipment and leave written feedback.
- Ratings and comments will be shown on each equipment's detail page as well as in the owner's dashboard.
- Owners see reviews for their equipment and overall ratings.
- Admin users can review/manage all feedback.

## Implementation – First Step

This PR will:
1. Update the router to add stubs for all new main routes, including placeholders.
2. Update the navigation for role-specific menu items.
3. Add file stubs for new pages with basic placeholder UIs.
4. Adjust the color scheme in `style.css` for a more vivid, engaging palette.
5. Make small visual tweaks (e.g., notification indicator in header, highlight states, more colorful buttons).

## Implementation – Payments & Feedback (Next Steps)

- Enhance `paymentsPage.js` with a simulated bookings/payment table, pay button, and receipt download.
- Enhance `reviewsPage.js` to show a form for submitting reviews after a completed booking, as well as a list/table of past reviews.
- On equipment details, display reviews and average rating.
